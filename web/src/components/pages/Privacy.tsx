                    <p>
                        <strong>We don't collect any data.</strong> This application runs entirely in your browser.
                        Your audio files are processed locally on your device and are <strong>never</strong> uploaded to any server.

                    <h2>Local Processing</h2>
                    <p>
                        All audio separation is performed using WebGPU or WebAssembly directly in your browser.
                        The model is downloaded once and cached locally by your browser. No audio data ever leaves your device.
